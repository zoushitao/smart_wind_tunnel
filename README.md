# smart_wind_tunnel

As the UAV market grows, so does the demand for UAV testing. Traditional wind tunnel experiments suffer from many problems such as large footprint, only providing static airflow and difficult operation. In contrast, active simulation wind tunnels are a much more powerful tool for simulating airflow phenomena within the atmospheric boundary layer, and can provide UAVs with a small footprint and high dynamic performance test bed. This paper explores a way to construct a highly dynamic active simulation wind tunnel using a 40x40 sized DC motor array.
