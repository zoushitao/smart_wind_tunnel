# smart_wind_tunnel

Traditional wind tunnel experiments suffer from many problems such as large footprint, only providing static airflow and difficult operation. In contrast, active simulation wind tunnels are a much more powerful tool for simulating airflow phenomena within the atmospheric boundary layer, and can provide UAVs with a small footprint and high dynamic performance test bed. This project explores a way to construct a highly dynamic active simulation wind tunnel using a 40x40 sized DC motor array.

## Supported Modes

- 💨 even wind : This refers to the situation where the wind speed and direction remain constant.
- 💨 gust wind : It refers to a brief but intense change in wind speed. Sudden winds may be caused by instability of airflow or topographic
influence of the terrain.
- 💨 sheer wind : This refers to the continuous change in wind speed that occurs with changes in altitude. Gradient winds are usually found in the . occur in the atmospheric boundary layer.
- 💨 wave wind : Refers to the phenomenon of fluctuations propagating through the atmosphere, usually caused by terrain, air currents or other atmospheric dynamics. Waves can have an unsettling effect on the flight of a UAV, such as causing bumps or jerks.
